==== greeter client

Currently, there are two separate clients: demo_client.go which uses http and demo_wsclient which uses websocket. 

The goal is to have a single REST client that transparently supports the Websocket
protocol in addtion to http to interact with the greeter server.

The client side code has been generated from the included https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elakito/swagsock/master/examples/greeter/swagger.yaml[swagger.yaml] using go swagger (version 0.13.0) by
----
$ swagger generate client -f swagger.yaml -A greeter-demo
----


===== Run

Make sure the greeter server is started (refer to https://github.com/elakito/swagsock/tree/master/examples/greeter)
