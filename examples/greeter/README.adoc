==== greeter server

This greeter server is a REST server that transparently supports the Websocket
protocol. This Websocket binding is originated from Atmosphere's websocket binding [1],
which in turn is originated from SwaggerSocket[2].

This binding can be considered as a simplified yet more efficient and flexible version of its predecessor.

The server side code has been generated from the included https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elakito/swagsock/master/examples/greeter/swagger.yaml[swagger.yaml] using go swagger (version 0.13.0) by
----
$ swagger generate server -f swagger.yaml -A greeter-demo
